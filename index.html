            <p><em>Aspiring <strong>Web Developer</strong></em></p>
    <p>Since a young age, I've sought jobs that would challenge me and provide a sense of accomplishment. 
    During my time as a Marine and US Army soldier, I thrived under pressure and developed problem-solving skills while working as part of a team. 
    Having completed my service, I'm now eager to take on my next challenge in the tech industry.

    With 7 years of combined service in the US Marine Corps and Army, I've developed a strong passion for leadership, mentorship, and problem-solving. 
    My background in military communications as a Radio Operator fueled my interest in technology and its endless possibilities.

    The Washington Vet to Tech program was a turning point for me, as it opened my eyes to the exciting world of coding. 
    I was immediately drawn to the challenge and complexity of programming, staying up late and tackling problem after problem. Today, I am a veteran eager to start a career as a Web Developer or Designer.

    My military background has instilled in me core values of high integrity, self-reliance, critical thinking, professionalism, and leadership. 
    I am confident that I can bring these qualities to any organization and make a positive impact. I am passionate about working with a team and thrive in both team and individual settings. 
    I am eager to join a company that values my unique experiences and abilities. Some place that I can call home.</p></td>
